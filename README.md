### Hi, I'm Alejandro 👋

I’ve always been a computer geek, but I originally studied Biotechnology.  
After realizing the lab wasn’t quite my place, I turned to programming —both academically and practically.  
Now, I combine my two passions: biology 🧬 and informatics 💻.

#### 🔬 About Me
- 🎓 Finishing my PhD in Structural Biology, focused on GPCR research and Molecular Dynamics simulations.  
- 🤖 Currently learning about Machine Learning and Neural Networks, a field I’m becoming increasingly passionate about.  
- 📚 Most of my PhD work is private until publication, but I’m always happy to talk about it!  

#### 💡 Beyond Research
- 🎸 I play the guitar and love discovering new music.  
- 🏋️ I work out regularly and enjoy trying all kinds of sports (even if I’m not great at them).  
- 🎲 I’m a big fan of board games —especially the complex ones with rulebooks nobody wants to read (but I do).  
- 🎮 I also enjoy videogames, especially indie titles (because my GPU can handle those).  

Nice to meet you! :)
